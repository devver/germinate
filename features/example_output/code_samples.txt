Hi there!  Here's a Hello, World method:

def hello
  puts "Hello, World!"
end

The immediately following code sample can be implicitly referenced:

def nameless
  puts "I have no name"
end

Or explicitly referenced

def foo
  puts "foo"
end

Samples can be referenced by name

def fred
  # This comment is part of the sample
  puts "Hello, my name is Fred"
  puts "la la la"
end

Or by index:

def boring
  1 + 1
end

SOURCE is a special sample which contains this entire source file.
