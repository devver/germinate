== 1.1.0 / 2009-07-12

* 1 major enhancement
  * Added post-pipeline excerpting, e.g. $SOURCE|ruby:/def foo/../end/
    Post-pipeline excerpting executes the process against the entire sample and 
    then excerpts the output.
* 1 minor enhancement
  * Processes applied to $SOURCE will be given the actual source path instead of
    a temp file
