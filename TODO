<2009-07-12 Sun> My mistake... the shell was interpreting the $SOURCE directive.
    
* DONE Make $SOURCE use the actual source file path in processes
  CLOSED: [2009-07-12 Sun 19:46]

* TODO Alternate directive syntax                           :usability:
  one that doesn't conflict with RDoc

* TODO Anonymous processes                                  :feature:
  A process that doesn't match a predefined process name should be interpreted
  as a shell command.

* TODO Code indent                                          :feature:
  Define an indent (either N spaces or a string) to be applied to code sections.

  Should first de-indent code.

  e.g. "@mysample:/def foo/..._"

* TODO Format Pipelines                                     :feature:
  Define a pipeline to be run on the entire article after formatting

  Or maybe just demote "format" to be a built-in publisher.
* TODO ERB Substitution                                     :feature:
  Should be run on TEXT sections.

  This will require giving Hunks the knowledge of their source offset.
  
* TODO Nested samples                                       :feature:
  Might want to wait this on the implementation of nested states in AlterEgo.

* TODO Optionally capture STDERR from processes             :feature:

  Workaround: Authors can just include 2>&1 in their process definitions.

* DONE Syntax for post-process excerpting                   :feature:
  CLOSED: [2009-07-12 Sun 20:50]
  E.g. "$SOURCE|ruby:/---/../---/"

  This would cause the process to be run on $SOURCE and then a subset of the
  output to be excerpted.
